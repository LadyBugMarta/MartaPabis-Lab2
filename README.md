## :white_check_mark: Note pocket
The note pocket will remind you about important information, events or things to do which you had posted. It allows you to add a note with the title, description, and priority. You can also choose a suitable color and delete it when unnecessary or obsolete. Notes are saved in local storage and appearing from the newest to the oldest, but these with priority are always at the top. You won't forget about anything this time.
